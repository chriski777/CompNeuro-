%Chris Ki, June 2017, Gittis Lab
%fanoFactorAnalysis: Performs fano Factor analysis to analyze self-similarity
%   over a range of time scales. The fano factor is defined as the variance
%   of the spike count divided by its mean.
%
%   SPKC = A single spike train vector where each entry is the timepoint at
%       occurence of a spike
   fanoFactor = 1;
